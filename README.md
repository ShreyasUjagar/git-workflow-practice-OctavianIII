## [CloudBees CEO: State of Software Development is a Disaster](https://devops.com/cloudbees-ceo-state-of-software-development-is-a-disaster/)

The idea that DevOps has caused an overall decrease in productivity is an interesting take that runs counter to my prior understanding of the subject. However, despite the hook in the title and the beginning of the article, it does shift to a more mid-ground perspective part of the way through.  
Overall, the discussion about AI and LLMs in the article was the most interesting to me. It makes sense that LLMs would help make DevOps, and software engineering as a whole, more efficient. I wonder how long it will take for those changes to start making notable impacts on the workplace, especially considering the security concerns involved with sharing sourcecode with ChatGPT.
